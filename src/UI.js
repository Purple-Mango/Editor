 * This module is the main controller for the editor's user interface

/*
 * This module does not need to contain any page behavior for

 * by calling trivial events in the renderer (such as a viewport zoom)
 * or by receiving data from the engine layer and sending relevant
 * renderer updates to the layer for processing there.
